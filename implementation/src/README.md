# Recreation Guidelines
**STRICTLY FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES, DO NOT USE THIS FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES**
For detailed instructions see section 4.5 in the thesis, starting on page 32. 

# Payload Generation
To create the payload, you will need to have an executable and a PNG image, any will do.
After that, simply run the creation script in `create.sh` to conceal the payload in the image.
Your image will now contain a payload ready to be embedded in the malicious document.

# Document Creation
Create a new Microsoft Word document, then drag and drop the image into it. Copy the contents of the 
`macro.vb` file into the macros of the created document.
