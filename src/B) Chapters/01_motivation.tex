\section{Introduction}
\section{Main motivation behind the thesis}
\section{Clearly say what the problem is and why other related techniques/tools don't solve it}
\subsection{What is the problem of this work?}
\subsection{Why do existing techniques/tools not solve it?}
\section{Clearly state the goals of your work; discuss the metrics how you can measure success}
Primary Goal:
  Recreate a past malware attack and analyse its efficiency if it were used today
Metrics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Functionality of the attack
  \item Detection by antivirus software
  \item Ease of detection by user
\end{itemize}

\section{Briefly explain the process of your work and the methods you used}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Analyse the past malware attack in question
  \item Recreate the code behind the attack, engineering a similar file to the one used in the attack (with no malicious payload)
  \item Test the attack in virtual machines emulating various operating systems
\end{enumerate}

\section{Crisply summarize your main contributions at the end of the motivation section}
